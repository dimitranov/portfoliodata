Some among them are %firebase , %redux  and %react-router ."

Redux allowed us to have full control for the total state of the application and change it in an immutable fashion from any component that we like."

First, we have a %/ route which renders the %Home Component, after then we have %/discover ,  %/toprated , %/upcoming basic routes each rendering their page component. Then we have %/movie/:movieId route and /tv/:tv=Id those are routes with parameters , rendering a %<Movie/> or %<TvShow/> component. Later on, i will explain why and what is this parameter. Then we have the two special routes, the First one %<LoginRoute/> is used for rendering both %<Login/> and %<Registration/> components, The routes function like this: %this.state.authed value, this value is a %boolean ( if its %true the user is logged in already, if %false it's not),  on entering this route first  thing that we do is check this value of the state if its %false meaning that  we dont have a crrentlyLogged user we can render the registration  of  login component and user can log in to creating an  accout, but its the value is %true  on the other hand we have an awready loged user that we %<Redirect/> to the %/ route and render the <Home/> component. The other Custom route is the <PrivateRoute/> this route renders the user personal list of Movies and TV shows, again the login is the same but reversed if a user is logged - display the %/mylist router if no <Redirect/> to the %/ route."
